    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made by layering wide, flat pasta sheets with rich sauces, cheeses, and various fillings. Traditionally, it features a hearty meat sauce, such as Bolognese, paired with creamy b√©chamel or ricotta cheese, and topped with a generous layer of melted mozzarella. Baked until golden and bubbling, lasagna combines savory flavors and comforting textures in each slice. Its layered structure not only delivers a satisfying bite but also makes it a popular choice for family gatherings and festive meals. Variations of lasagna can include vegetables, different meats, or even seafood, making it a versatile favorite across cuisines.
