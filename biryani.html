    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>Biryani is a flavorful and aromatic rice dish originating from South Asia, known for its layers of spiced rice, tender meat (like chicken, mutton, or beef), or vegetables. The dish is made by cooking basmati rice with a blend of spices such as saffron, cardamom, cumin, and cloves, creating a rich, fragrant base. Often accompanied by a side of yogurt or a boiled egg, biryani is a festive meal that brings together a beautiful balance of flavors, textures, and colors, making it a beloved dish in many cultures. Whether served at family gatherings or special occasions, biryani’s tantalizing aroma and bold taste are always a hit.
